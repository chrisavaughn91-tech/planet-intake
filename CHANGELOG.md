# Planet Intake ‚Äì Change Log

## Change 2a ‚Äî Test harness sync (2025-09-26)

- Updated `scripts/test-scrape.sh` to target **port 3000** and trigger `GET /run/full?max=‚Ä¶`.
- Updated `scripts/test-e2e.js` to **trigger a run** (no SSE parsing). Prints server JSON and tips to watch `/live`.
- E2E environment:
  - `E2E_SERVER` (default: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`)
  - `E2E_LIMIT` (default: `10`)
- Rationale: Codespaces has **3000 public**, **8080 private**. Test scripts should use the public route and match `/run/full`.


> Protocol: Each change is numbered (Change 1, 1b, 2, ‚Ä¶). We commit *full-file* replacements and update SoT after your confirmation. This log is the human-readable timeline.

# Prior Changes (preserved)

## 2025-09-21 ‚Äî Change 1C: Fallback for ‚ÄúListed #‚Äôs‚Äù when Call flow is blocked/redirected
- Add `harvestHeaderListedNumbers(page)` to scan the header/hero strip near the primary lead name for phone tokens.
- In `scrapePlanet`, after `harvestClickToCall(page)`:
  - If **no numbers** were captured:  
    - If we were bounced off the detail page, `goto(absUrl)` to return.  
    - Clear overlays, **do not click Call again**, and run `harvestHeaderListedNumbers(page)`.
    - Treat these as the **listed #** results (they‚Äôre merged into the `c2c` list so counts and badges work unchanged).
- 7-digit phones are included and flagged ‚ÄúNeeds Area Code‚Äù; they will show under **Flagged Numbers** in the sheet.
- No changes to special/premium math or policy scraping.

## 2025-09-21 ‚Äî Change 1B: Blocking modal overlay handling
- Add `closeBlockingOverlays(page)` to detect/dismiss `.modal-backdrop`, `body.modal-open`, and ARIA dialogs.
- Invoke overlay clearing after navigation, before click-to-call, and at the start of detail parsing.
- Add a guarded retry in click-to-call if the dropdown was blocked.
- No behavior change when no modal is present.

## 2025-09-21 ‚Äî Change 1A: Due Day "00" hardening (no behavior change)
- Feed raw token (e.g., `"00"`) directly into `normalizeDueDay(...)` in `parseLeadDetail`.
- Log now shows `dueDay` raw and normalized day explicitly (e.g., `dueDay=00 ‚Üí norm=31`).
- No change to active/lapsed gating or premium math.

## 2025-09-18 ‚Äî Change 2: paginator collects all pages
- Fix: Inbox pagination now collects links on every page (including last page)
- Impacted file: src/scraper.js (collectPaginated loop only)
- Notes: Live log shows "page 1 of ~N", "Go to next page", "page 2 of ~N", etc.
- Result: All 122 leads processed when page size = 100 + 2 pages present
